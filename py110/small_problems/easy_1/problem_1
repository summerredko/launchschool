# Write a program that solicits six (6) numbers from the user 
# and prints a message that describes whether the sixth number appears among the first five.
# Input: 6 integers
# Output: string interpolation with inters
# Rules:
# 	Explicit: 
# 		Ask for 6 numbers
# 		Print message - is last number among five?
# 	Implicit:
# 		Structure to store input from user
# Data Structures:
# 	Add integers to list

# Algorithm:
# 	1. Ask the user for a number six times
# 	2. Add the numbers to a list
# 	3. If the last number is within the first five numbers of list
