# Input: string
# Output: string

# Rules:
# Explicit:
# 	Take in a string.
# 	Swap first letter with the last letter of each work
# 	Every word has at least one letter
# 	The string will always have one word
# 	Strings only contain words and space
# 	But no leading, trailing or repeated spaces


# Implicit: None
	
		
# Questions: None

	
# Data Structures:
# 	Strings
# 	Lists


# Algorithm:
# 	Take in a string, then split all words into a list. 
# 	Loop through each word in the list and swap first and last letters.

#   If the word is only 1 letter, add it to the new list without operation.

#   Slice the first letter off the word. Then slice the last letter off the word.
#   Save those slices. Then concatenance the middle of the word with the reverse position
#   of the first and last letters.

# 	Join words in list back together as one string.
# 	Return that string
