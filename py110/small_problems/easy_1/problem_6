# Input: string
# Output: dictionary
	
# Rules:
# Explicit:
# 	Count the length of words in each string
# 	Words are separated by white spaces
# 	Add word count to a dictionary
#   Exclude non-letters
	

# Implicit: 
	
		
# Questions:
# 	Are punctuation included in the word count?
# 	Are numbers included in word count?
	
# Data Structures:
# 	string
# 	dictionary
	

# Algorithm:
# 	Take in string
# 	Break string into list separated by white spaces
# 	Loop through the string
# 	Count the number of characters in each word
# 	Add the word count to a dictionary
# 	Update the word count totals
