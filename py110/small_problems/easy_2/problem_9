# Input: list
# Output: strings and integers

# Rules:
# Explicit:		
# 	take in a list
# 	count the total number each element appears in the list
# 	print the element and number of times it appears 
# 	words are case sensitive

# Implicit: None
			
# Questions: None
	
# Data Structures:
# 	dictionary

# Algorithm:
# 	take as list as an argument 
# 	loop through the list
# 	count the number of times an element appears
# 	print each element and it's number
