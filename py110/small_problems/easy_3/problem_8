# Input: two integers
# Output: list

# Rules:
# Explicit:	
# 	Take in two integers as arguments.
# 	The first number is a count and second is a start number
# 	Return a list containing the same number of elements as count
# 	Every element should be a multiple of the start number

# Implicit: None
	
# Questions: None
	
# Data Structures:
# 	List
# 	Range constructor
	
		
# Algorithm:
# 	Take in two integers as arguments.
# 	Create a list 
# 	Create a range from start number, adding the number of elements 		as count number
# 	Multiple each element from start number
# 	Return list

def sequence(count, start_num):
    # new_list = []
    # for i in range(1, count + 1):  # Generate count elements starting from 1
    #     new_list.append(i * start)  # Multiply index by start value
    # return new_list 
    return [start_num * num for num in range(1, count + 1)]

print(sequence(5, 1) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])          # True
print(sequence(4, -7) == [-7, -14, -21, -28])     # True
print(sequence(3, 0) == [0, 0, 0])                # True
print(sequence(0, 1000000) == [])                 # True
